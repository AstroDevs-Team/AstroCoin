AstroCoin is a fun and interactive clicker game where players earn AstroCoins by clicking on a specific image. Each click reduces the battery percentage, which automatically recharges over time, ensuring that gameplay is both strategic and engaging. The app also tracks the recharge process in real-time and during the periods when the app is not active.

- **Simple User Interface:**
